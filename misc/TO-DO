-  Explore environmental storytelling for some levels, with the story concept mostly in place.
-  Start on FS GOLD after first and Second Crunch reach its main goal. Potential of 72 levels with multiplayer with adds prologue, and epilogue. (WIP)
-  Freedom Scoops Arena is optional and for fun. We would need to do 32 levels. Freedom Scoops Gold may or may not replace arena in future. (optional) 

# Compiler and Building
